Within the field of machine learning, there are two main types of tasks: supervised, and unsupervised. The main difference between the two types is that supervised learning is done using a **ground truth**, or in other words, we have prior knowledge of what the output values for our samples should be. Therefore, the goal of supervised learning is to learn a function that, given a sample of data and desired outputs, best approximates the relationship between input and output observable in the data. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, does not have labeled outputs, so its goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points.

Supervised
	1. Classification - discrete output 
	2. Regression - continuous output

1. Supervised traditional machine learning. This includes linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree and etc. You can learn the basic of gradient descent, which is the key for deep learning.  
2. Unsupervised traditional machine learning. This includes k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbors, methods of moments and etc.   
3. Supervised deep learning. For example CNN, LSTM and etc.  
4. Unsupervised deep learning. For example GAN, self-organizing map (SOM), auto-encoding/decoding.
