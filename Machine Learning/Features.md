"Feature" is a term that is used frequently in ML literature. It's used in multiple different contexts, but essentially refers to a specific element in a vector (feature vector), where that vector is a representation of a system. When this vector is an input into a model, it is referred to as the "data" or an "input vector". A feature vector that exists somewhere during the processing of an ML model is some transformation of the input vector with the weights, biases, and an activation function. The size of this vector can be greater than the input vector, suggesting that new "features" have been identified that were not explicitly defined. This is what is meant when we say that a neural network is learning the implicit structure within data

The term “feature” in machine learning refers to an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Features are crucial components of machine learning models as they help the model understand and learn from the data. Here’s a breakdown of how features are used in different contexts within machine learning:

**Input Features**

• **Feature Vector**: This is the initial set of features derived from the raw data. Each element in this vector represents a specific feature or attribute of the data. For example, in a dataset of houses, features might include the number of bedrooms, square footage, and age of the house.

**Feature Transformation**

• **Intermediate Features**: When an input feature vector is processed through a machine learning model, it undergoes transformations involving weights, biases, and activation functions. These transformations result in intermediate feature vectors at various stages of the model.

• **Learned Features**: These are new features that the model derives through its layers and transformations. They capture complex patterns and relationships in the data that were not explicitly defined in the original feature set. This process is fundamental to neural networks, as it allows them to learn and represent abstract features that contribute to the final decision-making process.

**Feature Space**

• **Dimensionality**: The dimensionality of the feature vector can change as it passes through a model. The size can increase if the model learns additional features or transformations, reflecting the model’s ability to capture more complex relationships in the data.

• **Feature Engineering**: This involves creating new features from existing data to improve model performance. This can be done manually by domain experts or automatically by the model through its learning process.

**Role in Model Learning**

• **Implicit Structure**: Neural networks and other models learn the implicit structure of the data by identifying and leveraging relationships between features. This ability to discover and utilize hidden patterns is a key strength of deep learning models, allowing them to make accurate predictions and classifications even with complex, high-dimensional data.

Understanding features and how they are transformed and utilized in a model is crucial for designing effective machine learning systems. It highlights the importance of both initial feature selection and the model’s ability to learn new, meaningful features from the data.

It seems the difference between NN and traditional machine learning models like decision trees is that a NN can decide to create it's own features based on relationships it can identify, where as a decision tree is only capable of working with the features it's been given.
